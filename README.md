# Spelling Bee

## Description

**Spelling Bee** is an interactive application aimed at enhancing language translation experiences. It allows users to dynamically transition between different language options within the application, providing seamless translation for text and data.

In the **Spelling Bee** game, players are challenged to find words using the yellow cell in the middle of the grid. Points are awarded to players based on the length of the words they correctly enter. With word lengths ranging from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 7 letters, users engage in a thrilling race against time to find 10 words.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
